# yuki

Linear algebra for graphics purposes based on [pbrt3](http://www.pbr-book.org/) ([source](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3)). An excercise in new stuff like proc_macros and thorough testing.

`yuki_derive` was inspired by [derive_more](https://github.com/JelteF/derive_more), though the implementation itself is quite specific to how I want my error handling. It also supports "deriving" ops with scalar values as well as other "vectors" of matching dimensions.
